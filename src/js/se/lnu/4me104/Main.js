/**
 *	The main class for the mashup example. This class is 
 *	responsible for initiating the application components 
 *	(widgets). If new components are created, they will 
 *	be added via this class.
 *
 *	This class is written as a static JavaScript class. 
 *	The static format is suitable because the class is 
 *	never meant to be instantiated. The instance that is 
 *	stored in the main property is accessible via the 
 *	browser window object, ie in the global scope.
 *
 *	NOTE: All JavaScript files under se.lnu.4me104 should 
 *	be "compiled" or joined into a js file for increased 
 *	performance. For this code to remain easy to read, I 
 *	have chosen not to "compile" it.
